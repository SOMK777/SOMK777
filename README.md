- 👋 Hi, I’m Somnath Khatei,
- 👀 I’m interested to work in the technical aspects of Electrochemistry, Secondary battery manufacturing, Environment Safety, Material Testing & Analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently Working as a Research Engineer at DRDO in Strategic Battery Division. I work on 40-50 Ah, upto 107 Wh/kg new battery technologies to meet
onboard energy power requirements of DRDO and spin off for Civilian applications using HR5 Cells (1.3V to 2.05V).
With a team of 7 members, I develop and qualify primary reserve battery (Thermally Stable utilization of 89.4 percent @500degC 33.9 percent @ 700 deg C)
and secondary batteries (HR5, HR10, HR25 cells) for missiles and torpedoes like Agni Prime series, LRAShM, MIRV and Varunastra.

• Lab testing of battery performance, operating Programmable Logic Control systems and remote triggering for
battery testing. Good understanding of material science and analytical skills, will make me an asset for the
organisation.

• Authored Research paper on LYP battery which provides information on battery performance at (-40 to
+60) deg Celcius 3C high rate capability currently the paper is in process for publishing.

• Designed cell parameters of HR5 secondary battery process Automation using technical recources available
at DRDO. Hands-On experience on cell manufacturing.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cell manufacturing and Material Science study.
